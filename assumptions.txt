Some assumptions that I've made about the behavior of the Servers and Customers in this simulatiosn include that
the Customers join the line as soon as they arrive, that they do not cut in line, that they do not leave the line or switch lines, 
that they make decisions on which line to join based on which line is the shortest (taking into account which Servers are busy),
and that they leave their Server as soon as their service is finished. For the Servers, I've assumed that they don't go on break, 
that their shift does not end until all Customers have been served, that they do not invite Cus tomers waiting in other lines 
into their line when not busy, and that they do not take any time in between Customers.
